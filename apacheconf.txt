these steps i perform

sudo apt update

sudo apt install apache2

sudo systemctl status apache2 its active and running

sudo ufw app list  to list all currently available UFW application profiles

sudo ufw allow in "Apache" To only allow traffic on port 80, use the Apache profile

sudo ufw status its active 


to check public ip   curl ifconfig.me

http://39.43.187.155    my server public ip

sudo apt install mariadb-server

sudo mysql_secure_installation

sudo mariadb                     This will connect to the MariaDB server as the administrative database user root


sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql  installing php


 php -v    to check the version

sudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf

add index.php file in this Apache will first look for a file called index.html. We want to tell the web server to prefer PHP files over others, to make Apache look for an index.php file first. If you donâ€™t do that, an index.html file placed in the document root of the application will always take precedence over an index.php file.

sudo systemctl restart apache2

sudo systemctl status apache2   it is running and active 

now lampstack configurtion is completed now i start configuartion of wordpress
